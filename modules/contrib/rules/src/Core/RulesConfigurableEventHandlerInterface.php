 * Configurable events have a custom event suffix, which gets appended to the
 * base event name (= the plugin id), forming the fully-qualified event name,
 * which is used for triggering reaction rules.
 *
 * For example, the fully-qualified event name of an event for viewing an
 * article node would be "rules_entity_view:node--article", whereas
 * "rules_entity_view:node" is the base event name and "article" the event
 * suffix as returned from ::getEventNameSuffix().
 *
 * The event name suffix must be generated from the event data at run-time,
 * while the configured plugin has to determine it based upon the event
 * configuration.
