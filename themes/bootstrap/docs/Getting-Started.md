# Getting Started

## Installation
- Install the Bootstrap base theme in `themes` or a similar `sites/*/themes`
  folder.
- Enable the [Drupal Bootstrap] base theme.

## Bootstrap Framework Fundamentals
Generally speaking, you should really read the entire [Bootstrap Framework]
documentation site, if you haven't already. Here are the four basic "sections"
that site is split into:

- [Getting Started](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started) - An overview of
  the [Bootstrap Framework], how to download and use, basic templates and
  examples, and more.
- [CSS](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) - Global CSS settings, fundamental HTML
  elements styled and enhanced with extensible classes, and an advanced grid
  system.
- [Components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) - Over a dozen reusable
  components built to provide iconography, dropdowns, input groups, navigation,
  alerts, and much more.
- [JavaScript](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/) - Bring the
  [Bootstrap Framework] components to life with over a dozen custom jQuery
  plugins. Easily include them all, or one by one.
